Certainly! Let me break down the logic implemented in the provided code:

### HTML:
1. **Structure**: Defines the basic structure of an HTML document.
2. **Viewport and Charset**: Specifies the character set and viewport settings for better responsiveness.
3. **Stylesheet Link**: Links an external CSS file for styling.
4. **Title**: Sets the title of the webpage.
5. **Body**: Contains the main content of the webpage.
   - **Container**: Holds the expanding cards.
   - **Panels**: Individual cards representing different categories.

### CSS:
1. **Box Sizing and Font**: Sets box-sizing to border-box and selects the font.
2. **Body Styling**: Styles the body, making it a flex container, centering content, and hiding overflow.
3. **Container Styling**: Styles the container for the expanding cards.
4. **Panel Styling**: Styles each panel (card) with background images, border-radius, and other properties.
5. **Panel Title Styling**: Styles the title within each panel.
6. **Active Panel Styling**: Adjusts styles for the active (expanded) panel.
7. **Media Query**: Adjusts styles for smaller screens, hiding some panels.

### JavaScript:
1. **Panel Selection**: Selects all panels (cards).
2. **Click Event Listeners**: Adds a click event listener to each panel.
   - When a panel is clicked, it removes the 'active' class from all panels and adds it to the clicked panel.
3. **Remove Active Classes Function**: Defines a function to remove the 'active' class from all panels.

### Overall Logic:
- Clicking on a panel triggers the event listener.
- The `removeActiveClasses` function removes the 'active' class from all panels.
- The clicked panel gets the 'active' class, making it expand (based on CSS transitions).
- The CSS rules handle the visual transition effects, such as panel expansion and title opacity.
- Media queries ensure a responsive design for smaller screens.

This logic creates an interactive webpage where clicking on a card expands it while contracting others. The CSS provides styling, and JavaScript manages the dynamic behavior of the expanding cards.
