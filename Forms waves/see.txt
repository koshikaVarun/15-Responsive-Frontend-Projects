
In the provided CSS code, the styling for `.form-control label span` is applied to the `span` element
s within a `label` element that likely corresponds to the labels associated with form controls. 
Let's break down the properties:

```css
.form-control label span {
    display: inline-block;
    font-size: 18px;
    min-width: 5px;
    transition: 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55);
}
```



- `display: inline-block;`: This property sets the display type to inline-block, allowing the `
span` elements to be treated as block-level elements while remaining in line with the text.

- `font-size: 18px;`: This property sets the font size of the `span` elements to 18 pixels.


- `min-width: 5px;`: This property sets a minimum width of 5 pixels for the `span` elements. This 
can be useful for preventing the `span` elements from collapsing to a width of 0 if their content is empty or very short.



- `transition: 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55);`: This property specifies the transition effect for changes to 
the `span` elements. It has a duration of 0.3 seconds, and it uses a cubic Bezier timing function (`cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55)`).
 The cubic Bezier function defines the acceleration curve for the transition. In this case, it determines how the font size changes over time when the transition is triggered.


The cubic Bezier function `cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55)` has specific values for the control points, affecting the speed and easing 
of the transition. It seems to be designed to produce a particular visual effect for the speed of the letters changing, likely for a smooth and visually pleasing animation.
